"a bit about yourself." Kidding.
I'm just happy to be at least giving this part of my life another go. I went to college at Eastern Kentucky University and graduated with a double major in Technology and Computer Networking. I did my first 2.5 years in programming and I wish I hadn't given up. I just thought I didn't have enough time to dedicate to this one hard class because of my job. I grew up dirt poor, yada yada, you've heard it. My parents actually cashed in my savings bonds from when I was a baby to get me my first computer. But, anyways back to why I'm not a network analyst. So my counsler convinced me to declare the new majors because it was the latest thing. Ummm.  
So I did a whole other route after college for different reasons, but my buddy from highschool had a girl drop off these flyers at his office and he called me about it. So, I stopped and got one. 
Game on.
